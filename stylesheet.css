/* CSS FOR SIDEBAR */




/*  Sets the sidebar so it is only on the left side of the page. 
    The items in the container are centered, and they are aligned
    in a column. The position is fixed so it will stay still as
    you scroll down the page. It also has a set width.

    I also used flex display in this class as well as others.
    I used the website 'Interneting is Hard' as a refrence
    for coding this. I didn't know of it before, but when I 
    learned about flex display, the code was exactly what I wanted my 
    website to do. The link is here:
