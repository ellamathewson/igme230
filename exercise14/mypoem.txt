<p id="verse1">A dessert, however hard it tries, <br>
Will always be tasty. <br>
Does the dessert make you shiver? <br>
does it?<br></p>

<p id="verse2">How happy is the yummy dinner! <br>
Now luscious is just the thing, <br>
To get me wondering if the dinner is delicious.<br></p>

<p id="verse3">
I cannot help but stop and look at the yellow brunch.<br>
Does the brunch make you shiver?<br>
does it?<br> </p>
