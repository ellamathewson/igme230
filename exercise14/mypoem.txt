<p id="verse1">A dessert, however hard it tries, <br>
Will always be tasty. <br>
Does the dessert make you shiver? <br>
does it?<br></p>

<p id="verse2">How happy is the yummy dinner! <br>
Now luscious is just the thing, <br>
To get me wondering if the dinner is delicious.<br></p>

<p id="verse3">
I cannot help but stop and look at the yellow brunch.<br>
Does the brunch make you shiver?<br>
does it?<br> </p>

<p id="verse4">
How happy are eggy omelettes! <br>
Do omelettes make you shiver? <br>
do they? <br> </p>

<p id="verse5">
A dessert, however hard it tries, <br>
Will always be yummy. <br>
Are you upset by how luscious it is? <br>
Does it tear you apart to see the dessert so toothsome? <br>
 </p>

<p id="verse6">
Just like a love, is the dinner. <br>
Now dumpy is just the thing, <br>
To get me wondering if the dinner is heavyset. <br>
</p>
