            <ul>
                Nathan G provided the link to Font Awesome that I used at the head of each page. I was having an issue where the icons 
                were not displaying once uploaded to GitHub, and his line of code answered it for me. I was using href when I 
                should have been using src. 
            </ul>
        <a class="toSource" href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_css_dropdown_navbar_click">

            <ul>
                These two sources were the basis of the code for my dropdown menu. The first link showed me how to create 
                a dropdown menu, while the second link showed me how to have it appear when the screen size changes. 
            </ul>
        <a class="toSource" href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_shadows.asp">
            https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_shadows.asp</a>
            <ul>
                I used this source for a specific box-shadow line of CSS, which is used for the nav bar across every page.
                I liked the shadow effect it had.
            </ul>
        <a class="toSource" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17833678/count-number-of-img-tags-inside-a-div-tag">
            https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17833678/count-number-of-img-tags-inside-a-div-tag</a>
            <ul>
                The code from this source comes from Darius Morawiec, who explained how to count the number of 
                elements inside a specific div. I used this line of JavaScript for the nav bar on the projects 
                page, which sorts the projects based on the type of project. 
            </ul>
        <a class="toSource" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4825295/javascript-onclick-to-get-the-id-of-the-clicked-button">
            https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4825295/javascript-onclick-to-get-the-id-of-the-clicked-button</a>
            <ul>
                This source also helped with creating the nav bar on the projects page. When a link is pressed on, 
                this code showed me how to have JavaScript grab the id of the link. I used this to get the id and 
                use it as a parameter in the function to sort the projects. 
            </ul>

            <ul>
                This source went through how to create a printable page with CSS. I used it with the resume page 
                so employers can print it with ease.
            </ul>

            <ul>
                From this source I learned how to add placeholders inside text divs so the forms have the labels 
                of which box is which inside the text box. When the user clicks on them and types in their answer, 
                the label goes away.

        <h4>Challenges: </h4>
        <p><strong>Project Nav Bar</strong></p>
        <ul>
            This aspect to my website was particularly challenging. The nav bar on the projects page has the 
            ability to sort the projects based on what the project is. I divided it into four main groups: 
            JavaScript, HTML and CSS, Design, and C#. I ended up removing the C# category because as of right 
            now I do not have any C# projects completed. 
        </ul>
        <ul>
            Using JavaScript, when the link is pressed, I needed certain projects to disappear from the page 
            and certain ones to stay. This was challenging because I needed to get the id of every project and 
            look for specific ones. I also needed to know how to obtain the correct number of projects that 
            were on the page. 
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Responsiveness</strong></p>
        <ul>
            This aspect was challenging in a different way. It was challenging to try and rework all of my 
            pages for a different window size, as a lot of aspects needed to be changed in order for the 
            content to look right. 
        </ul>
