        <p class="aboutPara">Hello, I'm a second year student studying at Rochester Institute of Technology, where I'm 
            majoring in New Media Interactive Development. I'm able to code in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, 
            and C#. Along with this, I am well versed in Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign.

            <br><br>

            During my time at RIT, I have taken classes such as Digital Survey 1 and 2, as well as 
            Interactive Design and Algebra Problem Solving 1 and 2, which have taught me in-depth 
            about design and programming. I have also worked on personal projects, which include an 
            interactive game for a Women in Computing Hackathon on campus, Alumni Posters designed 
            for Women in Computing club at RIT, as well as an interactive web game called Boogie 
            Worms.

            <br><br>

            I love overcoming challenges and finding solutions to problems, which is why I am always
            looking for new projects to work on. 
        </p>

        <p class="aboutPara">
            Outside of academics, I play tennis through the RIT Tennis Club, which I also 
            help run as vice-president. I'm also a member of a volunteer organization called Momentum, 
            where I learn leadership skills as well as volunteer in the Rochester community. 

            Currently I work as a Teaching Assistant in the IGM departmnet, grading for two introductory
            JavaScript courses.
