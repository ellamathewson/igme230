                    <p class="projectPara">Along with the previous exercise, we learned about events in JavaScript. Using an 
                        HTML form, selecting radio buttons changes the events on the page in terms of text displayed and 
                        the color of other text.

                    <p class="projectPara">Similar to the previous exercise, titled "DOM Exercise 1", we learned about JavaScript
                        changing the HTML code, such as adding more elements or delete elements from the page.

                    <p class="projectPara">For this exercise we learned the basics of including JavaScript in our program
                        and how to call elements on the page to change them.

                    <p class="projectPara">In this exercise, we learned about SVGs, and the different ways to include them
                        in an HTML document. On this page, there are two copies of the same SVG. The first SVG on the left
                        is included in the file as an image. The second SVG, with a black border around it, is coded into
                        the HTML file.

                    <p class="projectPara">This exercise taught us about CSS animation and transitions. We used base code

                    <p class="projectPara">In this exercise we followed an MND Article to create a basic HTML form. The form
                        does not yet send the information anywhere, as we were more focused on learning the HTML and CSS
                        to create it.

                    <p class="projectPara">This exercise was a continuation of Exercise 3a, where we implemented CSS into
                        the site. Most of it was used in order to mimic a Wikipedia page, which is where the information
                        is from.

                    <p class="projectPara">This exercise was done in order to learn more specific containers for content
                        on the web in order to better code for search engines, as well as clear up our program. We took a
                        random wikipedia file and formated the content in HTML. No CSS was used.
